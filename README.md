This gem is heavily influenced by the [spyke][] gem which requires
`activesupport 4.0` or above where as the `pdc` gem needs to run against
`activesupport 3.2.22`. If you are using `activesupport 4` (rails 4) or above
and is looking for json api to ORM framework please consider using [spyke][] instead.
